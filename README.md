Resets
======

My Sass and SCSS reset files.

These were originally based off of [Eric Meyer's original css
reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) then tweaked over the years
through repetitive use until I arrived at a version that never needed to change
per project.

Many of the latest revisions borrow quite heavily from
[normalize.css](http://github.com/necolas/normalize.css).
